        <h2>Why 'adopt' a language?</h2>
        <p><a href="../index.html">R6Maps.com</a> is designed to support multiple languages for nearly every feature (ironically though this page is English only :).&nbsp; If you use the site and speak another language (or have enough patience), please consider helping create translations.</p>
        <p>Translations are needed for general terms like the side menu and stats functionality.  However, map room labels take most time: about 9-12 hours currently for all maps & about one hour per season after.&nbsp; Of course you will be thanked on the <a href="about.html">about page</a>, and your work will benefit many other users!</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You do not need to be a coder to provide translations!&nbsp; You can enter translations in a spreadsheet <strong>or</strong> enter them directly in code, depending on your comfort level.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 1: Pick a Language</h2>
        <p>The about page contains a list of languages that need to be translated.  Some languages only need ongoing help, such as for new maps or new site features while others would be new for the site.<p>
        <h3>Please email <a href="mailto:r6maps@gmail.com?Subject=Translations">r6maps@gmail.com</a> to indicate if you can help with a language.</h3>
        <p>You will then be added as a contributor to the shared spreadsheet, or a placeholder column will be added if you are entering translations directly in code.&nbsp; Although it is possible for multiple people to work on a language together, this will help reduce the chances of wasted duplicate effort.<p>

        <h2>Step 2 - Option A: Enter terms in a spreadsheet</h2>
        <h3>If you are not familiar with modifying website code:</h3>
        <p>You can enter translations directly in a Google spreadsheet.&nbsp; After emailing <a href="mailto:r6maps@gmail.com?Subject=Translations">r6maps@gmail.com</a> (see "step 1" above), you will be added as a contributor to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJL1S5rC4LGWlH0FRmdbyfjIQmxbpv8pLFICVP6qhsE/pubhtml">Google spreadsheet</a>.&nbsp; Please review the notes in the spreadsheet and email any questions you may have.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For both Step 2 options, some care should be taken to try to match translations to what appears in-game.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 2 - Option B: Enter terms in code</h2>
        <h3>If you are comfortable with modifying website code and Github pull requests:</h3>
        <p>You can enter translations directly in code, previewing changes in real-time while running the site locally.&nbsp; The code is available <a href="https://github.com/capajon/r6maps/issues/">here on Github</a>.&nbsp; Please review the README for some instructions on running the site locally (you will need to install npm and build some javascript files).</p>
        <p>Additionally, there is an <a href="https://github.com/capajon/r6maps/pull/84/files">example PR here</a> that you can use as a reference for files that need to be updated.  It may become out of date but can hopefully still be used as a helpful example.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Step 3: Spread the word :)</h2>
        <p>Once the new language is available on the live site, please consider posting about it - especially on sites where users speak the new language.&nbsp; This will help more users benefit from your hard work!</p>
        <p>Also, you will be asked to provide a name (or handle if you prefer) and link, so that you can be credited for your effort.&nbsp You can refer to existing thank you notes on the <a href="about.html">about page</a> for examples.</p>
        <p><strong style="text-transform:uppercase">Thank you for considering helping out!</strong></p>
